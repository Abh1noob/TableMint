# TableMint

Transform your API responses into production ready tables in no time.

## The Problem

Frontend developers constantly face the same frustrating cycle when building data tables:

* **Boilerplate Hell**: Every new table requires hundreds of lines of repetitive code
* **API Integration Gap**: No streamlined way to go from API response to working table
* **Type Safety Overhead**: Manually creating TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas for every data structure

**The result?** Developers spend more time on table boilerplate than building actual features.

## The Solution

**TableMint** generates complete, production ready table implementations including pagination, filtering, and search with a single command.
